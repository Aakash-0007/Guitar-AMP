Description:
The Virtual Guitar AMP Controls is a React-based web application that simulates the functionality of an amplifier for an electric guitar. The application allows users to adjust the volume, bass, mid, and treble levels in real-time using their microphone as an input source. It provides a cost-effective alternative to buying a physical amplifier, making it accessible to guitarists who want to experiment with their sound without investing in additional hardware.

Key Features:

Real-time Audio Processing: The application uses the Web Audio API to process the audio input from the user's microphone in real-time.

Adjustable Sound Settings: Users can control the volume, bass, mid, and treble levels using interactive sliders, modifying their guitar's sound according to their preferences.

Visualizer: A real-time frequency visualizer provides a visual representation of the audio signal, allowing users to visualize the impact of their adjustments.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and can be used on various devices, making it convenient for guitarists to tweak their sound on the go.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface and managing component-based interactions.
Web Audio API: For handling real-time audio processing, including gain control and equalization (EQ).
Canvas: To create the real-time frequency visualizer.
MediaDevices API: To access the user's microphone input.
